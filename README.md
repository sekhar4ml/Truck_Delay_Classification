# **Build End-to-End ML Pipeline for Truck Delay Classification**
The project addresses a critical challenge faced by the logistics industry. Delayed truck shipments not only result in increased operational costs but also impact customer satisfaction. Timely delivery of goods is essential to meet customer expectations and maintain the competitiveness of logistics companies.
By accurately predicting truck delays, logistics companies can:
* Improve operational efficiency by allocating resources more effectively.
* Enhance customer satisfaction by providing more reliable delivery schedules.
* Optimize route planning to reduce delays caused by traffic or adverse weather conditions.
* Reduce costs associated with delayed shipments, such as penalties or compensation to customers.
